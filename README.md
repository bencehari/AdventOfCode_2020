# Advent of Code 2020

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl).

I'm learning C, so it's in C.

Just run make in the 01, 02, etc folders and run with ./01, ./02, etc on MacOS or Linux or without the ./ on Windows (theoretically, I doing this on a MBP).

Cheers
